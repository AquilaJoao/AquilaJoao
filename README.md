- Hi, I’m @AquilaJoao, currently living in Brazil and only 20 yrs old.
- Working as a system dev at a local enterprise called LTCloud. Im a junior dev with some experiences in PHP, Ruby, JS, Angular, Ionic, Flutter, React and Electron.
- I have a huge interest in game dev, always trying to learn everything thats related to it, such as drawing, creating animations and even some 3D arts.

You can reach me at jaquila.dev@gmail.com

I hope I can show a little bit of my creations here and also help whoever needs with the experience i've earned so far, and of course, learn a lot.

Byee
